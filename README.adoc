Work is based on `tellduslive` component by `@molobrakos`. The ambition is to turn his components for Telldus Live! into a component for Telldus LocalAPI.

What is it
==========

This is an experiment if you can bypass the Telldus Live! service and rely upon the Local API published by the TellStick instead. A working prototype is available in 'components' folder. It required very few changes to the original component, the changes basically amounting to modifying setup slightly and then rewriting the authentication.

Documentation of Local API is found at http://api.telldus.net/localapi/api.html

Tested with Hassio and Telldus TellStick ZNet Lite v2
